# AI_2324

This is my solution to the AI course at Berkley university, available at [Pacman](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa23/projects/)
The project consists of 5 parts:

- Search
- Multi-Agent Search
- Reinforcement Learning
- Bayes Nets and HMMs
- Machine Learning

There is also a part around CSPs, but that is from my own university: University of Antwerp.
