\section*{Report 5: Pacman Ghostbusters}

\section*{Question 6}
\subsection*{Write down the equation of the inference problem you are trying to solve}
The equation we are trying to solve in the function \textbf{observeUpdate()} is:\\
    $ \prob{X \mid Z} = \dfrac{\prob{Z \mid X} \cdot \prob{X}}{\prob{Z}} $

\section*{Question 7}
\subsection*{Write down the equation of the inference problem you are trying to solve}
% P(newPos | oldPos, gameState) = Î£ P(newPos | oldPos) * P(oldPos | gameState)
The equation we are trying to solve in the function \textbf{elapseTime()} is:\\

    $ \prob{X \mid Y, Z} = \sum \prob{X \mid Y} \cdot \prob{Y \mid Z} $

Where:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item $ X = newPos $
\item $ Y = oldPos $
\item $ Z = gameState $
\item $ \prob{X \mid Y, Z} $ is the updated belief about the ghost being at position newPos given the old position oldPos and the current game state gameState. This is what we are trying to compute.
\item $ \prob{X \mid Y} $ Is the probability of the ghost moving to position newPos given that it was at position oldPos.
This is obtained from the \textbf{getPositionDistribution} method
\item $ \prob{Y \mid Z} $ is the current belief about the ghost being at position oldPos given the current game state \textbf{gameState}.
This is stored in \textbf{self.beliefs[oldPos]}
\end{itemize}
\section*{Question 8}
\subsection*{Can you think of a better strategy than the greedy strategy?}

\subsection*{Describe how Pacman can use the probability values to their advantage and more effectively hunt ghosts}

\subsection*{Mark the average score of the greedy strategy and of your alternative in your report.}

\section*{Question 14}
\subsection*{In both tests, pacman knows that the ghostswill move to the sides of the gameboard. What is different between the tests,and why?}
